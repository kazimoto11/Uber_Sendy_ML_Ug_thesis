In the Sub-Saharan Africa, logistics increases the costs of manufactured goods by up to 320%, while in Europe it only accounts for 90% of manufactured goods cost (Dupoux et al., 2019). Therefore, new technologies for both service enhancement and disruption emerge as online retailers and their logistic partners are being challenged to embrace bold new approaches in order to survive, compete and provide better services to their customers.
Hence, the objective of the research is to use logistic data to build machine learning models to predict courier delivery time in the last-mile delivery service. Data from Sendy, a logistics company from Nairobi, Kenya and the Uber Movement Nairobi dataset were used to build two machine learning models; linear regression and a neural network model.
The project’s methodology was done in an iterative process that included data pre-processing and feature engineering to prepare the data for modelling and then, evaluate the performances of the models by minimizing the training and test dataset errors. The neural network model performed better than the linear regression model because of its ability to understand far more complex features and relationships between features and the targeted outcome.

The solution developed in the study will help Sendy enhance customer communication and improve the reliability of its service by building artificial intelligent applications on the machine learning models to predict courier delivery times of their logistic operations.In the Sub-Saharan Africa, logistics increases the costs of manufactured goods by up to 320%, while in Europe it only accounts for 90% of manufactured goods cost (Dupoux et al., 2019).
